# COVID-19 and Crime in Mexico City

## Problem Description
COVID-19 has understandably been a topic of intense focus in 2020, with research professionals from across the spectrum contributing their knowledge to the efforts to mitigate the negative effects of the pandemic. Many of these efforts have sought to trace and explain the societal impacts of the virus and corresponding policy responses around the world. This project aims to add to these efforts using data from Mexico City. Specifically, the project looks at data concerning crime, violence, and the virus in order to better understand how policymakers might combat Gender-Based Violence (GBV) during the pandemic. 

## Background
In research compiled by [UN Women](https://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/facts-and-figures), an alarming body of evidence points to increasing violence against women during the pandemic. A [recent study](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.jcrimjus.2020.101745) by Balmori de la Miyar, Hoehn-Velasco, and Silverio-Murilloc (2020), in contrast, found that domestic violence has actually decreased during the pandemic in Mexico City, according to data reported by the office of the Attorney General. Many factors could be behind this apparent contradiction, including the fact that the majority of Gender-Based Violence goes unreported (see [data](https://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/facts-and-figures#notes) from UN Women). 


## Data Use
This project is currently in development, which means the data sources and analysis techniques used could change or expand in order to facilitate the researcher's ability to meet the project aims and objectives. In its current form, the project uses public data from https://datos.cdmx.gob.mx, a portal maintained by the Mexican Government to promote transparency and open access to public information. The analysis pulls from two main datasets: "Casos a nivel nacional asociados a covid-19 para la CDMX" [(link)](https://datos.cdmx.gob.mx/explore/dataset/carpetas-de-investigacion-pgj-de-la-ciudad-de-mexico/export/) and "Carpetas de investigación FGJ de la Ciudad de México" [(link)](https://datos.cdmx.gob.mx/explore/dataset/casos-asociados-a-covid-19/export/). The first dataset contains information on suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases that have been reported. The second contains information on crimes reported within the city limits. 

In analyzing these datasets, the project will use a series of Data Science tecnniques to explore the data and build models that help explain how Gender-Based Violence and COVID-19 are connected. In doing so, the project intends to develop tools that assist policymakers in detecting and mitigating the risk of underreported GBV during the global health crisis.
